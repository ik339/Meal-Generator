# Welcome to a Meal generator program!
 It is important to keep a healthy diet when exercising. There are a few important components of a meal, such as protein, carbohydrates, vegetables, and fats. This program randomly generates a meal combination from a list of components. It picks one item from each list at random. It then displays the concatenated result. This program can be run multiple times.
 
The aim of this is to help individuals to make healthy meal choices, when on a journey of looking after one's body.
